# Detector Geometries

## Predefined Detectors

Currently, three classes of detectors are supported: Coaxial, Inverted Coax, and BEGe type detectors.

All detector properties are specified in a one-for-all .json file.

### Example 1) Inverted Coax

Example minimum config file for an Inverted Coax detector (IVC) plus explanations.
**Remember**, comments are not allowed in JSON files and have to be deleted if you want to use it.
```json
{
}
```
