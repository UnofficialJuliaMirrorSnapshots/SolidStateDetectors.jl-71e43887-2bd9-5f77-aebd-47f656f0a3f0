# Weighting Potentials

## Simulation Algorithm

The weighting potential for an electrode is internally calculated with the same function as the electric potential.

The only difference is that the charge carrier density ``œÅ(\vec{r})`` is set to `0`
and all electrodes are fixed to `0` but the one electrode which is fixed to 1.
